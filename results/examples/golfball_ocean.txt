Question: How many golf balls put into the worlds oceans would it take to submerge all of the land on earth from the displaced water? (units: 3.20E+13);
Context:
Correct Answer: 3.20E+13
Compiled Answer is: 8.098790268912682e+37
Summarized Problem is:  We are adding golf balls to the ocean and they displace water such that all of the land on Earth gets submerged. We want to compute the number of golf balls that we need to add to the ocean.
Program:
```python
# Q0: How many golf balls put into the worlds oceans would it take to submerge all of the land on earth from the displaced water?
# R0: This is the main question we want to answer.
# Q1: What is the volume of water that will be added to the ocean?
# R1: If we know the volume of water that will be added to the ocean, then we know how much water is needed to submerge all of the land on Earth and so we can compute the number of golf balls we need to add to the ocean.
# Q2: What is the volume of land on Earth that is above sea level?
# R2: The volume of water that will be added to the ocean is the same as the volume of land on Earth that is above sea level since all of the land on Earth gets submerged.
# Q3: What fraction of the Earth's surface is land?
# R3: To compute the volume of land on Earth that is above sea level, we need to know what fraction of the Earth's surface is land because we can multiply that by the surface area of the Earth and then multiply that by the average elevation of land to get the volume of land on Earth that is above sea level.
# F3: One third of the Earth's surface is land.
A3=1/3 # (dimensionless)
# Q4: What is the surface area of the Earth?
# R4: To compute the volume of land on Earth that is above sea level, we need to know the surface area of the Earth because we can multiply that by the fraction of the Earth's surface that is land and then multiply that by the average elevation of land to get the volume of land on Earth that is above sea level.
# F4: The surface area of the Earth is 1.97e+8 mi**2.
A4=1.97e+8 # (mi**2)
# Q5: What is the average elevation of land?
# R5: To compute the volume of land on Earth that is above sea level, we need to know the average elevation of land because we can multiply that by the surface area of Earth that is land to get the volume of land on Earth that is above sea level.
# F5: The average elevation of land is 0.5 mi.
A5=5e-1 # (mi)
# F2: The volume of land on Earth that is above sea level is the fraction of the Earth's surface that is land multiplied by the surface area of the Earth multiplied by the average elevation of land.
A2=A3*A4*A5 # (mi**3)
# F1: The volume of water that will be added to the ocean is the same as the volume of land on Earth that is above sea level.
A1=A2 # (mi**3)
# Q6: What is the volume of a golf ball?
# R6: To compute the number of golf balls we need to add to the ocean, we need to know the volume of a golf ball because we can divide the volume of water that will be added to the ocean by the volume of a golf ball to get the number of golf balls.
# F6: The volume of a golf ball is 2.87 in**3. We must convert this into mi**3 by multiplying by (5.208e-11 ** 3).
A6=(5.208e-11 ** 3) * 2.87e+0 # (mi**3)
# F0: The number of golf balls we need to add to the ocean is the volume of water that will be added to the ocean divided by the volume of a golf ball.
A0=A1/A6 # (golf balls)
