Question: If 100% of the energy of all lightning strikes around the world could be harnessed and used, what percentage of the world's power could be supplied by lightning strikes? (units: 8.10E-09);
Context:
Correct Answer: 8.10E-09
Compiled Answer is: 4.167916041979011e-11
Summarized Problem is: We capture all of the energy from all of the lightning strikes around the world and use it to supply power to the world. We want to compute what percentage of the world's power we are supplying.
Program:
```python
# Q0: If 100% of the energy of all lightning strikes around the world could be harnessed and used, what percentage of the world's power could be supplied by lightning strikes?
# R0: This is the main question we want to answer.
# Q1: How much energy is produced by all lightning strikes around the world?
# R1: To compute what percentage of the world's power we are supplying, we need to know how much energy lightning strikes produce because we are capturing 100% of this energy.
# Q2: How much energy does one lightning strike produce?
# R2: To compute the total energy produced by all lightning strikes, we need to know how much energy one lightning strike produces because we can multiply this by the number of lightning strikes to get the total energy produced.
# F2: One lightning strike produces about 1 GJ of energy. We must convert this into the same units as the world's power, which are kWh, by multiplying by 0.278.
A2=0.278 * 1e+0 # (kWh)
# Q3: How many lightning strikes are there around the world per year?
# R3: To compute the total energy produced by all lightning strikes, we need to know how many lightning strikes there are because we can multiply this by the energy produced by one lightning strike to get the total energy produced.
# F3: There are about 100 lightning strikes per second on Earth. The number of seconds in a year is 31536000. Therefore, there are about 1.00e+9 lightning strikes per year.
A3=1e+9 # (1/year)
# F1: The total energy produced by all lightning strikes is the energy per strike multiplied by the number of strikes.
A1=A2*A3 # (kWh/year)
# Q4: How much power does the world use?
# R4: To compute the total power that we could potentially supply, we need to know the total power that the world uses because we are comparing the power we generate to the total power the world uses.
# F4: The world uses about 6.67e+12 MWh/year of power. We must convert this into kWh/year by multiplying by 1e+6.
A4=6.67e+12 * 1e+6 # (kWh/year)
# F0: The percentage of the world's power that could be supplied by lightning strikes is the total energy produced by all lightning strikes divided by the power the world uses.
A0=A1/A4 # (Dimensionless: %)
```

Question: If 100% of the energy of all lightning strikes around the world could be harnessed and used, what percentage of the world's power could be supplied by lightning strikes? (units: 8.10E-09);
Context: - The total energy generated by lightning in a year is 4.7e+18 J
- The total energy consumption in the world annually is 575e+24 J
Correct Answer: 8.10E-09

Summarized Problem is: REVISED
Program:
```python
# Q0: If 100% of the energy of all lightning strikes around the world could be harnessed and used, what percentage of the world's power could be supplied by lightning strikes? (Same as original question Q0)

# F1: The total energy generated by all lightning strikes in a year is 4.7e+18 J. We must convert this into the same units of the world's energy consumption, which are kWh, by multiplying by 2.78e-7. (Revised fact based on new context)
A1=4.7e+18 * 2.78e-7 # (kWh/year)
# Q2: How much power does the world use? (Same as original question Q4)
