Here is my reasoning:
```python
# Q0: How heavy would Peter Griffin + Clifford the Big Red Dog be?
# R0: This is the main question we want to answer.
# Q1: What is the weight of Peter Griffin?
# R1: To compute the combined weight of Peter Griffin and Clifford the Big Red Dog, we need to know the weight of Peter Griffin.

A1=1.979e+2 # (lbs)
# Q2: What is the weight of Clifford the Big Red Dog?
# R2: To compute the combined weight of Peter Griffin and Clifford the Big Red Dog, we need to know the weight of Clifford the Big Red Dog.
# F2: Clifford the Big Red Dog is a cartoon character and his weight is not officially stated, but we can estimate his weight based on his size relative to humans in the cartoon. Clifford is about 25 feet tall, which is about 5 times the height of an average male Labrador Retriever. The average weight of a male Labrador Retriever is 70 lbs, so we can estimate Clifford's weight to be 5 times that.

# R0: This is the main question we want to answer.
# Q1: What is the energy required to destroy the moon?
# R1: If we know the energy required to destroy the moon, we can compute the amount of dynamite needed by dividing the energy required to destroy the moon by the energy released by one ton of dynamite.
# Q2: What is the gravitational binding energy of the moon?
# R2: The energy required to destroy the moon is the same as the gravitational binding energy of the moon since that is the energy required to overcome the gravitational forces holding the moon together.
# Q3: What is the mass of the moon?
# R3: To compute the gravitational binding energy of the moon, we need to know the mass of the moon because the gravitational binding energy of the moon is proportional to the mass of the moon.
# F3: The mass of the moon is 7.35e+22 kg. We must convert this into tons by multiplying by 0.00110231.
A3=0.00110231 * 7.35e+22 # (tons)
# Q4: What is the radius of the moon?
# R4: To compute the gravitational binding energy of the moon, we need to know the radius of the moon because the gravitational binding energy of the moon is inversely proportional to the radius of the moon.
# F4: The radius of the moon is 1.737 km. We must convert this into miles by multiplying by 0.621371. We must then convert this further into feet by multiplying by 5280.
A4=0.621371 * 5280 * 1.737e+0 # (ft)
# F2: The gravitational binding energy of the moon is 3/5*G*M**2/R where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the moon, and R is the radius of the moon.
A2=(3/5)*(6.674e-11)*(A3 ** 2)/A4 # (J)
# F1: The energy required to destroy the moon is the same as the gravitational binding energy of the moon.
A1=A2 # (J)
# Q5: What is the energy released by one ton of dynamite?
# R5: To compute the amount of dynamite needed to destroy the moon, we need to know the energy released by one ton of dynamite because we can divide the energy required to destroy the moon by the energy released by one ton of dynamite to get the amount of dynamite needed.
# F5: One ton of dynamite releases 4.18e+9 J of energy.
A5=4.18e+9 # (J)
# F0: The amount of dynamite needed to destroy the moon is the energy required to destroy the moon divided by the energy released by one ton of dynamite.
A0=A1/A5 # (tons)
