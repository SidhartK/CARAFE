Here is my reasoning:
```python
# Q0: How heavy would Peter Griffin + Clifford the Big Red Dog be?
# R0: This is the main question we want to answer.
# Q1: What is the weight of Peter Griffin?
# R1: To compute the combined weight of Peter Griffin and Clifford the Big Red Dog, we need to know the weight of Peter Griffin.

A1=1.979e+2 # (lbs)
# Q2: What is the weight of Clifford the Big Red Dog?
# R2: To compute the combined weight of Peter Griffin and Clifford the Big Red Dog, we need to know the weight of Clifford the Big Red Dog.
# F2: Clifford the Big Red Dog is a cartoon character and his weight is not officially stated, but we can estimate his weight based on his size relative to humans in the cartoon. Clifford is about 25 feet tall, which is about 5 times the height of an average male Labrador Retriever. The average weight of a male Labrador Retriever is 70 lbs, so we can estimate Clifford's weight to be 5 times that.
