Question: How much space would be required to fit 1 individual of each species of plants and animals? (units: cm**3);
Context:
Correct Answer: 56053870000 cm**3
Compiled Answer is: 8700000000000.0
Summarized Problem is:  We want to compute the space required to fit one individual of each species of plants and animals.
Program:
```python
# Q0: How much space would be required to fit 1 individual of each species of plants and animals?
# R0: This is the main question we want to answer.
# Q1: How many species of plants and animals are there?
# R1: If we know the number of species of plants and animals, we can compute the space required by multiplying the number by the average space required for each species.
# F1: There are approximately 8.7 million species of plants and animals.
A1=8.7e+6 # (species)
# Q2: What is the average space required for a plant or animal?
# R2: If we know the average space required for a plant or animal, we can compute the space required by multiplying the number of species by the average space.
# Q3: What is the average size of a plant or animal?
# R3: We can approximate the average space required for a plant or animal by assuming it is a cube and then computing the volume of that cube.
# Q4: What is the average height of a plant or animal?
# R4: To compute the average size of a plant or animal, we need to know the height because we can cube that to get the volume.
# F4: The average height of a plant or animal is 1 m. We must convert this into cm by multiplying by 100.
A4=100 * 1e+0 # (cm)
# F3: The average size of a plant or animal is approximated by cubing the average height.
A3=A4 ** 3 # (cm**3)
# F2: The average space required for a plant or animal is approximated by the average size.
A2=A3 # (cm**3)
# F0: The space required to fit 1 individual of each species of plants and animals is the number of species multiplied by the average space required for each species.
A0=A1*A2 # (cm**3)
